# Car_App
This repository includes files for my Software Engineering class.
This semester project is meant to walk us through process of creating an app or website from scratch

This app we have decided to make has the following goals:
  To have users put in information about their cars that is saved in app
  They then pick activities or objects to track
    ie. Oil changes, wiperfluid changes, mods, etc
  Then the app notifies them when to perform these maintenance tasks on their car
    The app does so based on a frequency the user sets
      every month, every two weeks, every 300 miles etc
  We also hope to include the capability to transfer maintenance and mod logs to another user
    in the scenario you sell you car
